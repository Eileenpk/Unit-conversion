# Unit-conversion
This was a scrimba project - build a unit conversion app with JavaScript. 
I used a figma file for the design of it.
Project requirements
-Save number to a variable in code
-When app loads, do calculations and display the results
-Round numbers to 3 decimal  places
-Stretch: add an input for the user to change the number and automatically recalculate values when it changes.
